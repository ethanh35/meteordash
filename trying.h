double angle() {
  double angle = 4200 + rand()% 1046;
  return angle / 1000;
}




//make a function that gives random angle
  
make a function that gives random x position
  
incorporate angle into draw meteor function
  draw meteors with an angle
  
change position update function so that meteors move along a trajectory
  
  
  
  
  
  
array
   meteor one is given its own angle, and its own x
   when it hits the ground, meteor two is drawn, with its own position and own x
     
     
     for(i=0;i<1000;i++) {
       m[i].angle = angle();
       m[i].met_pos.x = random_x();
       
if i want several meteors, just make another array for each meteor i want generated
